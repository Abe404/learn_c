    Assign the characters into numbers and then use printf to print them a character at a time. What kind of compiler warnings did you get?
    Do the inverse for name, trying to treat it like an array of int and print it out one int at a time. What does Valgrind think of that?
    How many other ways can you print this out?
    If an array of characters is 4 bytes long, and an integer is 4 bytes long, then can you treat the whole name array like it's just an integer? How might you accomplish this crazy hack?
    Take out a piece of paper and draw out each of these arrays as a row of boxes. Then do the operations you just did on paper to see if you get them right.
    Convert name to be in the style of another and see if the code keeps working.



### Stay focused on the tutorial, get it finished and come back to these other ideas later.
Not related to an exercise but: learn more about static analysis in clang.
 
ex3 - document all formatting options.

ex3 (man 3 printf documentation on formatting) "The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversation specifier." - What is type promototion?
https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx4cb.html (type converstion)

ex3: printf is clearly really conplex, maybe work through a few of the examples
in man 3 printf and make some more of my own to help understand.

ex4: 
From valgrind.org:
  The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality tools: a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache and branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache and branch-prediction profiler, and a heap profiler. It also includes three experimental tools: a stack/global array overrun detector, a second heap profiler that examines how heap blocks are used, and a SimPoint basic block vector generator.

  Write a summary of each of these tools and show in which situations they could be useful (write example programs that illustrate their use).

# what is .PHONY in a make file????

# ex8
Write about everything that effects the sizes used for integers.
(Its not just CPU)
(Seems compiler is a big deal)
