From this part of the extra credit:
Try assigning to elements of name and full_name.
Try setting one element of areas to a character from name.
* Go search online for the different sizes used for integers on different CPUs.
(read the docs saved in the integer size folder)

### Stay focused on the tutorial, get it finished and come back to these other ideas later.
 
ex3 - document all formatting options.

ex3 (man 3 printf documentation on formatting) "The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversation specifier." - What is type promototion?
https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx4cb.html (type converstion)

ex3: printf is clearly really conplex, maybe work through a few of the examples
in man 3 printf and make some more of my own to help understand.


ex4: 

From valgrind.org:
  The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality tools: a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache and branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache and branch-prediction profiler, and a heap profiler. It also includes three experimental tools: a stack/global array overrun detector, a second heap profiler that examines how heap blocks are used, and a SimPoint basic block vector generator.

  Write a summary of each of these tools and show in which situations they could be useful (write example programs that illustrate their use).


* Review the notes.md and address any TODO's

* Reaview plan c readme:
Read through the old notes form here (some of them mine)
