<h1>Notes on Learn C the Hard way</h1>

<p>Intended for me to document and answer my own questions about things I don&#39;t understand.</p>

<h3>EX2</h3>

<h4>What is ex1.dSYM and why is being created?</h4>

<h5>TODO mention its relation to clang.</h5>

<p>  It is a directory which includes debug information.</p>

<blockquote><p>On MacOSX debug symbols are often in stand alone bundles called dSYM files. 
These are bundles that contain DWARF debug information and other resources related to builds and debug info. [0]</p></blockquote>

<h4>What is DWARF debug information?</h4>

<blockquote><p>DWARF is a debugging file format used by many compilers and debuggers to support source level debugging. [1]</p></blockquote>

<p>For further info this is an 11 page introduction to the drawf debugging format [2]</p>

<h4>TODO: Read this and update my Makefile with anything that looks likei it could be useful</h4>

<p>https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/howto_makefiles.html</p>

<h4>TODO: Understand every command in this makefile, also take useful elements and add to my own.</h4>

<p>https://github.com/rohanorton/plan.c/blob/master/rohan<em>code/learn</em>c<em>the</em>hard_way/Makefile</p>

<h3>EX3</h3>

<h4>TODO: What else is in stdio.h apart from printf?</h4>

<h4>TODO: What are all of the printf excape codes and format sequences?</h4>

<p>Find all of the ones available, how you can modify them and what kind of 
&quot;precisions&quot; and widths you can do.</p>

<p>Some example excape codes are: \n or \t. </p>

<p>Some example format sequences are %s or %d.</p>

<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>

<p>TODO: Move these into links inline as it will get easier to break this file up if i need to do so in the future.
